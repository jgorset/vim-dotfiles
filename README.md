# VIM dotfiles

These are my VIM dotfiles. They're pretty great.

## Installation

Download and copy everything in `home` to your home directory, or use
[homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) and save
yourself the trouble:

    $ homesick clone jgorset/vim-dotfiles
    $ homesick symlink jgorset/vim-dotfiles

Set up [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim):

```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Launch VIM and run `:PluginInstall`.
